# cima-events

A website for easy and centralized event planning/management.

## Overview
CIMA Events is a website dedicated to helping users organize and plan events for 
their peers. This project aims to create a simple but enjoyable user interface 
made using Material UI 5 (MUI) to allow users to login and see the events of groups 
they're subscribed to. 

This is the main repository for the CIMA Events project.

The project is developed following the [MERN full-stack design architecture](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) with the 
addition of [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) for the front-end.

## Running
This project requires you to have Node.jsÂ® installed as the main dependencies are installed using the built-in Node Package Manager (npm).

Clone the repository. 

Create a file named `.env` containing the environment variables for your MongoDB. The environment variables `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`, `DB_HOST`, and `DB_NAME` should be defined. 

Use `npm install` to install all the dependencies listed in the package.json.

Start the web server using `gatsby develop` and you're good to go!
